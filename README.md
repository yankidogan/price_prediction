# Price Prediction

Price Prediction is a machine learning project that uses a neural network to predict a car's price based on its features. User enters the data for features including brand, year of registration, kilometer, power, damage status, fueltype and gearbox type of the car, and the model predicts a price for that type of car. This way, user can get an estimation about how much this type of car would cost.

The project was programmed in Python and MLP Regressor model of the Scikit-Learn library was used.The model was trained using AutoDataset.csv dataset.
